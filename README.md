## How AI Tools Were Used

During the development of this project, **AI tools** like ChatGPT were used in the following ways:

1. **Code Generation:** AI was used to generate and assist with writing boilerplate code for various React components and handling state management, improving productivity.
2. **Test Case Creation:** AI provided generated unit tests for various components to ensure proper testing coverage for component behavior and interactions.
3. **Troubleshooting:** AI helped troubleshoot issues such as module resolution errors (`Cannot find module`), configuration errors, and provided suggestions for resolving errors related to testing setups and environment configurations.
4. **Code Optimization:** AI offered suggestions for improving code structure, making it more efficient and adhering to best practices, especially in terms of React context and state management.
5. **Writing Documentation:** AI was used to draft and enhance the README, making it more comprehensive and easier for contributors to follow along.

## Known Limitations or Next Steps

While the project is functional, there are several areas where improvements could be made:

1. **Test Coverage:** While basic unit tests are in place, the application could benefit from more comprehensive tests, such as error handling and edge cases for various states (e.g., empty data states).
2. **UI and UX Enhancements:** The UI could be enhanced with more advanced design elements, animations, and better accessibility features. Improvements in responsive design would also be beneficial.
3. **Error Handling:** Implementing more robust error boundaries and improving error messages for failed operations (like API calls) will make the app more resilient.
4. **Performance Improvements:** The app could be optimized for better performance, particularly in handling larger datasets or reducing unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Although the app works well in modern browsers, cross-browser testing should be performed to ensure compatibility with older browsers or those with limited feature support.
6. **Backend Integration:** The project could be further expanded by integrating it with a real backend to handle appointments dynamically, providing persistent data storage.
